Full disclosure before we start: I'm the founder of Thallo. I'm going to do my best to be fair here because I genuinely respect what YNAB and Monarch Money have built, and I think dishonest comparison posts are the worst thing on the internet. I've spent months researching every major budgeting app — reading user reviews, digging through subreddits, talking to real users, and studying the competition deeply. I've built Thallo from the ground up, so I know our product inside and out, but my YNAB and Monarch insights come from extensive research, not years of personal use.

If you just want the short version: **YNAB is best for budgeting purists who want full manual control. Monarch Money is best for couples and families who want a polished all-in-one financial dashboard. Thallo is best for people who want AI-assisted budgeting with a free tier and a focus on overall financial health.**

Now let me actually defend those claims.

## How much do YNAB, Monarch Money, and Thallo cost?

Pricing is the easiest place to start because the differences are stark.

| | YNAB | Monarch Money | Thallo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly price** | $14.99/mo | $9.99/mo | Free forever |
| **Annual price** | $109/yr | $99/yr | Free / $79/yr / $149/yr |
| **Free trial** | 34 days | 7 days | Free tier (forever) |
| **Free tier** | No | No | Yes |
| **Family/couple sharing** | Yes (same account) | Yes (built-in) | Yes |

YNAB costs $109/year with no free tier. For a budgeting app. I know the YNAB community will say "it pays for itself," and for many people that's true — but it's a tough pill to swallow when you're trying to *save* money. It also went from $84/year to $99 to $109 over the past few years, which hasn't thrilled longtime users.

Monarch Money is $99/year or $9.99/month. More reasonable, but still no free option. They did drop from $14.99/month recently, which shows they're feeling competitive pressure.

Thallo has a genuinely free tier that covers Financial Health Score, budget tracking, debt & savings goals, CSV import, and basic streak tracking — free forever. Plus ($79/year) adds AI insights (5/day), Auto Budget Wizard (2/month), "Can I Afford This?" checks (3/week), receipt scanning (2/week), AI coaching (3/month), and full gamification. Pro ($149/year) unlocks everything including bank sync and unlimited AI features. You can budget indefinitely without paying a cent.

## What is YNAB's budgeting philosophy?

YNAB (You Need A Budget) is built around zero-based budgeting and their "Four Rules":

1. Give every dollar a job
2. Embrace your true expenses
3. Roll with the punches
4. Age your money

This is genuinely great methodology. YNAB didn't invent zero-based budgeting, but they made it accessible and even enjoyable. The "age your money" concept — tracking how long dollars sit before being spent — is clever and motivating.

**Where YNAB excels:** If you're willing to manually assign every dollar to a category, check in regularly, and treat budgeting like a hands-on practice, YNAB is exceptional. Their education resources are the best in the industry. The community (r/YNAB) is passionate and helpful. The methodology genuinely changes people's relationship with money.

**Where YNAB struggles:** It's a lot of work. Seriously. You're manually categorizing transactions, moving money between categories, reconciling accounts. Some people find this therapeutic. Others report finding it exhausting after the initial excitement wears off (a common theme on r/YNAB). YNAB also has a learning curve that can take weeks to get comfortable with. Their UI, while improved, still feels like software designed by engineers for engineers — a frequent critique from users who bounced to alternatives.

And at $109/year with no free tier, there's real irony in a budgeting tool that costs more than many of the subscriptions it helps you manage.

## What is Monarch Money's approach?

Monarch Money positions itself as the modern, clean alternative to Mint (RIP) and the complexity of YNAB. It's a financial dashboard first, budgeting tool second.

**Where Monarch excels:** The UI is gorgeous. Seriously, it's the best-looking personal finance app on the market. The net worth tracking, investment monitoring, and cash flow views are excellent. For couples, the shared access features are seamless — both partners get full visibility into shared and individual accounts. Monarch also handles account syncing better than most competitors, with fewer connection issues.

**Where Monarch struggles:** The budgeting features, while solid, aren't as deep as YNAB's. There's no true envelope/zero-based system. The app is more about financial *awareness* than financial *behavior change*. You can see where your money went, but the proactive guidance is limited. At $99/year, you're paying almost as much as YNAB but getting a different (some would say less transformative) product.

## What makes Thallo different?

Here's the honest origin story: I'm an econ major working in analytics. I'd never used a budgeting app before building Thallo — spreadsheets were my weapon of choice. What pushed me to build this was frustration with the credit score system (closed a card to simplify my finances, got punished for it), watching my fiancée manually track student loan payoffs in Excel, and realizing we could use AI to plan optimal payoff strategies but no app was doing this intelligently.

I built Thallo because I wanted three things that didn't exist together in one app:

**1. AI that actually helps with budgeting decisions.** Not just auto-categorization (though we do that). I'm talking about an AI that notices you've been spending $340/month on dining out when your budget is $200, and proactively suggests a realistic adjustment rather than just flagging it red. AI that spots your insurance renewal coming up based on last year's pattern and reminds you to shop rates.

**2. A Financial Health Score that goes beyond credit scores.** Credit scores measure how good you are at borrowing money. They don't show your savings rate, emergency fund, or whether you're building wealth. Thallo's Financial Health Score (0-1,000 points) measures three key pillars: **Trajectory** (where you're headed — 400 points), **Behavior** (how you handle money — 350 points), and **Position** (where you are now — 250 points). It's a holistic view of financial wellbeing, not just borrowing behavior. More on why this matters in [our financial health post](/blog/credit-score-financial-health).

**3. A free tier that's actually useful.** Not a 7-day teaser. Not a feature-stripped demo. A real, functional budgeting app with CSV import, budget tracking, debt & savings goals, and your Financial Health Score — all free forever. We make money when people *choose* to upgrade for AI features (Plus at $79/year) or bank sync (Pro at $149/year), not when they hit a paywall on day 8.

**Where Thallo is honest-to-God weaker:** We're newer. YNAB has 20 years of iteration. Monarch has a larger team and more integrations. Our investment tracking isn't as deep as Monarch's yet. And we don't have the massive community that YNAB has built — no subreddit with 300K members cheering you on. We're working on all of this, but I'd rather be straight with you.

## Who should pick YNAB?

Choose YNAB if you want a **hands-on budgeting practice**. If the idea of manually assigning every dollar feels empowering rather than tedious. If you want the best educational content and community in personal finance. If you've tried other methods and need the structure that YNAB's methodology provides.

YNAB's method *works*. Users report saving an average of $600 in their first two months and $6,000 in their first year. Those numbers are self-reported and probably skewed, but even if you cut them in half, the methodology clearly drives behavior change.

The $109/year price is worth it if you'll actually use it consistently. It's a terrible deal if you open it once a week, glance at your balances, and close it.

## Who should pick Monarch Money?

Choose Monarch if you want a **beautiful financial dashboard** that gives you a clear picture of your entire financial life. If you're a couple who wants shared visibility. If you care about investment tracking and net worth alongside budgeting. If you're coming from Mint and want the closest modern replacement.

Monarch is excellent at answering "where is my money and where did it go?" It's less focused on answering "where should my money go next?"

## Who should pick Thallo?

Choose Thallo if you want **AI to do more of the heavy lifting**. If you've tried YNAB and bounced off the complexity. If you don't want to pay $99-$109/year just to find out if budgeting apps work for you. If you care about financial health holistically, not just monthly budget compliance.

Thallo is best for people who want to start free, get intelligent guidance, and upgrade only when the value is obvious.

## Can you switch between budgeting apps easily?

Switching is annoying but doable. Most apps let you export transactions as CSV files. You'll lose your historical category assignments and any custom rules you've set up. Plan for about 30-60 minutes to set up a new app, connect accounts, and configure your categories.

My recommendation: don't switch mid-month. Finish out the current month with your existing tool, then start fresh on the 1st with the new one.

## FAQ

### Is YNAB worth $109 a year?
For dedicated users who engage with the methodology regularly, YNAB can save thousands per year in behavior change. For casual users who check in once a week, it's expensive compared to free alternatives like Thallo's free tier.

### Did Monarch Money replace Mint?
Monarch Money is the most common recommendation for former Mint users. It offers similar account aggregation and financial overview features with a more modern interface, though it costs $99/year compared to Mint's free model.

### What is a Financial Health Score?
A Financial Health Score measures your overall financial wellbeing on a 0-1,000 point scale across three pillars: **Trajectory** (where you're headed — 400 points), **Behavior** (how you handle money — 350 points), and **Position** (where you are now — 250 points). Unlike a credit score, which only measures borrowing behavior, a Financial Health Score reflects whether you're actually building wealth and financial stability.

### Can I use Thallo for free?
Yes. Thallo's free tier includes the Financial Health Score, budget tracking, debt & savings goals, CSV import, and basic streaks — free forever. Plus ($79/year) adds AI insights, Auto Budget Wizard, "Can I Afford This?" checks, receipt scanning, AI coaching, and full gamification (but no bank sync). Pro ($149/year) unlocks bank sync and unlimited AI features.

### Which budgeting app is best for beginners?
For beginners, Thallo or Monarch Money are the easiest starting points due to their intuitive interfaces. YNAB has the steepest learning curve but is the most transformative once mastered. If cost is a concern, Thallo's free tier lets you start budgeting with zero financial commitment.
