The average American household spends $475 per month on groceries. But "average" is meaningless when you're trying to set an actual budget. A single 25-year-old in Memphis and a family of five in Seattle should not be targeting the same grocery number.

Here's what you should actually spend, based on real data and the variables that matter.

## How much should one person spend on groceries per month?

The USDA publishes four food spending plans that give us the best benchmark data available. For a single adult (age 20-50) in 2025-2026:

| USDA Plan | Monthly Cost | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|---|
| **Thrifty** | $301 | Rice, beans, store brands, minimal meat, cooking everything from scratch |
| **Low-Cost** | $342 | Some variety, still mostly cooking at home, occasional name brands |
| **Moderate** | $425 | Comfortable grocery shopping, mix of fresh and convenience foods |
| **Liberal** | $541 | Organic options, premium ingredients, no real restrictions |

Most single adults should target the **low-cost to moderate range ($342–$425/month)**. If you're spending less than $300, you're either incredibly disciplined or not eating enough. If you're above $550, you're either in a very expensive city or your "groceries" category includes a lot of non-food items (cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc.).

## How much should a family of four spend on groceries?

This is the question everyone asks, and the USDA answers it specifically for a reference family (two adults, two kids ages 6-8 and 9-11):

| USDA Plan | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Thrifty** | $975 | $11,700 |
| **Low-Cost** | $1,054 | $12,648 |
| **Moderate** | $1,296 | $15,552 |
| **Liberal** | $1,612 | $19,344 |

A family of four spending $1,100–$1,300 per month on groceries is right in the normal range. If that number shocked you, you're not alone — grocery costs have risen roughly 25% since 2020, and many family budgets haven't caught up to reality.

## How should your grocery budget scale with income?

The percentage-of-income approach gives a useful sanity check. Here's a rough framework:

| Household Income | Suggested Grocery % | Monthly Budget (Family of 4) |
|---|---|---|
| Under $40,000 | 15-20% | $500-$667 |
| $40,000–$60,000 | 12-15% | $667-$750 |
| $60,000–$80,000 | 10-12% | $750-$1,000 |
| $80,000–$120,000 | 8-10% | $1,000-$1,250 |
| Over $120,000 | 6-8% | $1,250-$1,500 |

Notice something important: lower-income households spend a higher *percentage* on food even though they spend less in absolute dollars. A family earning $35,000 spending $600/month on groceries is already at 20% of their income — and that's the USDA thrifty plan level. There's no fat to cut.

If you earn over $100,000, your grocery spending as a percentage should naturally be lower, but many high-income families spend more because they can. Nothing wrong with that — just know the difference between "can afford" and "should spend."

## Why is my grocery bill so high?

If you're consistently overspending on groceries, it's almost always one of these five reasons:

**1. You're counting non-grocery items.** Walmart and Target runs include cleaning supplies, paper goods, toiletries, pet food, and household items. If everything from a "grocery store" goes into your grocery category, your food spending looks inflated. Separate food from household — it changes the picture.

**2. Food waste.** The average American household wastes 30-40% of the food they buy. That's roughly $1,500/year in the trash. If you're buying fresh produce with good intentions and throwing away wilted kale every week, meal planning will save you more than coupon clipping ever could.

**3. Convenience premiums.** Pre-cut vegetables cost 40-60% more than whole ones. Single-serve packages cost 50-100% more per ounce. Rotisserie chicken is a great deal; pre-made salad kits are a terrible one. I'm not saying never buy convenience — time has value — but know what you're paying for it.

**4. No meal plan.** Shopping without a plan leads to impulse buying. Studies show unplanned grocery trips cost 20-30% more than planned ones. You don't need a Pinterest-worthy meal prep board. A simple "these are the 5 dinners this week" note on your phone is enough.

**5. Shopping frequency.** People who shop once a week spend less than people who shop three times a week. Every trip is an opportunity for impulse buys. The $4 kombucha adds up when you grab one every other day.

## How do grocery costs vary by city?

Location is the single biggest variable most people ignore when comparing their grocery spending to national averages. The USDA numbers assume a national average cost, but real prices vary dramatically:

| City | Cost vs National Average |
|---|---|
| Honolulu, HI | +25% to +35% |
| San Francisco, CA | +20% to +30% |
| New York, NY | +15% to +25% |
| Seattle, WA | +10% to +20% |
| Denver, CO | +5% to +10% |
| Atlanta, GA | -5% to 0% |
| Dallas, TX | -5% to -10% |
| Memphis, TN | -10% to -15% |

If you live in Honolulu, the USDA moderate plan for a family of four isn't $1,296 — it's closer to $1,680. Adjust accordingly and stop comparing yourself to national averages when you're paying island prices.

## How can I lower my grocery bill without eating garbage?

I'm not going to tell you to give up coffee or stop buying avocados. Here are strategies that actually move the needle:

**Buy store brands for staples.** Store brand canned goods, pasta, rice, frozen vegetables, and dairy are 20-40% cheaper than name brands and usually identical in quality. Save your brand loyalty for the few items where you genuinely taste a difference.

**Anchor your meals around cheap proteins.** Eggs ($0.25/serving), dried beans ($0.20/serving), chicken thighs ($0.75/serving), and canned tuna ($0.80/serving) are nutritionally dense and incredibly cheap. You don't have to eat beans every night, but making them the base of 3-4 meals per week cuts your protein costs by half.

**Use the freezer strategically.** Buy meat on sale and freeze it. Freeze bread, bananas, and herbs before they go bad. Batch cook soups and stews on weekends. A well-stocked freezer is the single best tool for reducing food waste and resisting takeout on tired weeknights.

**Track your actual spending for one month.** Most people have no idea what they really spend on groceries versus what they think they spend. The gap is usually $100-$200/month. You can't fix what you can't see — and this is where a budgeting app genuinely helps. [Thallo](https://usethallo.com) lets you track groceries and household items as separate budget categories, so you can see your real food spending without household supplies inflating the number. Way easier than going through your bank statement with a highlighter.

## Should you include dining out in your grocery budget?

No. Absolutely not. Food at home and food away from home should be separate categories.

The average American spends $475/month on groceries and an additional $325/month on dining out — a combined $800/month on food. If you lump these together, you can't tell whether your high food spending is because groceries are expensive or because you're eating out too much.

Keep them separate. It's the only way to make useful decisions about either category.

## FAQ

### What is a reasonable grocery budget for one person?
A reasonable grocery budget for a single adult is $340–$425 per month in 2026, based on the USDA's low-cost to moderate food plans. Adjust up 15-30% for high-cost cities like New York or San Francisco, and down 10-15% for lower-cost areas.

### How much should a family of four spend on groceries per month?
A family of four should expect to spend $1,050–$1,300 per month on groceries in 2026, according to USDA food plan data. The national average is approximately $1,150/month, though this varies significantly by location and dietary choices.

### How can I cut my grocery bill in half?
Cutting your grocery bill by 50% requires aggressive changes: meal planning around sales, buying almost exclusively store brands, eliminating food waste through freezing and batch cooking, shopping once per week with a strict list, and building meals around the cheapest protein sources (eggs, beans, chicken thighs). Most people can realistically reduce spending by 20-30% with moderate changes.

### Are groceries more expensive in 2026?
Yes. Grocery prices rose approximately 25% between 2020 and 2025, driven by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and increased labor costs. While the rate of increase has slowed, prices have not returned to pre-2020 levels and are unlikely to do so.

### Should I budget for groceries as a percentage of income or a fixed amount?
A fixed amount based on your household size and local costs is more practical than a percentage. Use the USDA food plans as a starting point, adjust for your city, and track actual spending for one month to calibrate. Aim to keep groceries under 10-12% of gross household income if possible.
