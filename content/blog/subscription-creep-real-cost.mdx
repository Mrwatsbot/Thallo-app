The average American spends $273 per month on subscriptions. That's $3,276 per year. And most people, when surveyed, guess they spend about $86/month — off by a factor of three.

That gap between what you think you spend and what you actually spend is subscription creep in a nutshell. It's not that any single subscription is ruining you. It's that 15-25 small charges, many of which you forgot about, add up to a car payment.

## What counts as a subscription?

More than you think. When people hear "subscriptions," they picture Netflix and Spotify. But the full list for most households includes:

**Streaming & Entertainment**
- Netflix ($15.49-$22.99)
- Hulu ($9.99-$17.99)
- Disney+ ($9.99-$15.99)
- Max ($9.99-$20.99)
- Spotify/Apple Music ($10.99-$16.99)
- YouTube Premium ($13.99)
- Paramount+ ($7.99-$12.99)
- Gaming: Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus, Nintendo ($9.99-$17.99)

**Software & Productivity**
- iCloud/Google One storage ($2.99-$9.99)
- Microsoft 365 ($6.99-$9.99)
- Adobe Creative Cloud ($22.99-$59.99)
- Password manager ($3-$5)
- VPN ($5-$12)

**Health & Fitness**
- Gym membership ($10-$60)
- Peloton/fitness app ($12.99-$44)
- Meditation app (Calm, Headspace: $12.99-$14.99)
- Meal kit service ($60-$120)

**News & Information**
- New York Times/Washington Post/Wall Street Journal ($4-$16 each)
- Substack newsletters ($5-$15 each)
- Podcast subscriptions ($3-$8)

**Shopping & Convenience**
- Amazon Prime ($14.99)
- Walmart+ ($12.95)
- Instacart+ ($9.99)
- DoorDash DashPass ($9.99)

**Financial Services**
- Budgeting app (YNAB: $14.99, Monarch: $9.99)
- Credit monitoring ($10-$30)
- Identity theft protection ($8-$25)

**Miscellaneous**
- Phone insurance ($10-$18)
- Roadside assistance ($8-$14)
- Pet subscriptions (BarkBox, etc.: $23-$46)
- Dating apps ($15-$40)

Add those up and a "typical" American household easily hits $200-$350/month without subscribing to anything outrageous. Each one seemed reasonable when you signed up. In aggregate, they're your third-largest expense after housing and food.

## How do you audit your subscriptions?

**Step 1: Find them all.**

This is harder than it sounds because subscriptions are designed to be invisible. Three ways to surface them:

**Check your bank and credit card statements for the last 3 months.** Search for charges that repeat monthly or annually. Annual subscriptions are especially sneaky — they hit once, you forget, they hit again next year.

**Check your email for "receipt," "renewal," "subscription," and "your plan."** Your inbox has a record of almost everything you've signed up for.

**Check your app store subscriptions.** On iPhone: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions. On Android: Google Play → Payments & subscriptions. People are routinely shocked by what's billing through their app store — trials that converted, apps you used once, games your kid downloaded.

**Step 2: List every subscription with its cost and last use date.**

| Subscription | Monthly Cost | Last Used |
|---|---|---|
| Netflix | $15.49 | Yesterday |
| Hulu | $17.99 | 3 weeks ago |
| Disney+ | $15.99 | 2 months ago |
| NY Times | $4.00 | Last week |
| Calm | $14.99 | 6 months ago |
| Adobe CC | $22.99 | Never (kept "just in case") |
| BarkBox | $35.00 | Monthly (dog likes it) |
| Instacart+ | $9.99 | Monthly |

**Step 3: Apply the "last used" test.**

If you haven't used a subscription in 30+ days, cancel it. Not "pause" — cancel. You can always resubscribe. The resubscription barrier (3 minutes of effort) is exactly the friction you need to make intentional choices.

Exception: annual services you use seasonally (like a tax prep subscription used once a year). Everything else, the 30-day rule applies.

## How much can you actually save?

In my experience, most people can cut $50-$120/month by eliminating subscriptions they forgot about or rarely use. That's $600-$1,440/year.

The most common cuts:

**Redundant streaming services.** Do you really need Netflix AND Hulu AND Disney+ AND Max AND Paramount+ running simultaneously? Rotate them. Subscribe to one for a month, binge what you want, cancel, move to the next. At any given time, 1-2 streaming services is enough for most people. **Savings: $20-$50/month.**

**Unused fitness subscriptions.** The gym membership you haven't used since February. The meditation app you opened twice. The Peloton subscription after you stopped riding. **Savings: $15-$50/month.**

**The "I might need it someday" software.** Adobe Creative Cloud for the occasional PDF edit. A VPN you set up for a trip abroad. Professional tools for a side project you abandoned. **Savings: $10-$40/month.**

**Overlapping services.** Amazon Prime AND Walmart+ AND Instacart+? Google One AND iCloud AND Dropbox? Pick one per category. **Savings: $10-$25/month.**

## What about annual subscriptions you already paid for?

Check if they offer prorated refunds. Many do within 30-60 days of renewal. For the rest, set a calendar reminder for the renewal date and cancel the day before. This is critical because annual subscriptions are the ones most likely to auto-renew without you noticing.

Genuinely — put it in your calendar right now. "Cancel [subscription]" with the date set two days before renewal. Future you will be grateful.

## What's the psychology behind subscription creep?

Subscriptions exploit three cognitive biases:

**The anchoring effect.** "$9.99/month" feels trivial when you compare it to any single purchase. A coffee costs $6. So $9.99 for unlimited streaming is a "deal." But you're not comparing it to a coffee — you're adding it to a stack of twenty other $9.99 charges.

**Status quo bias.** Canceling requires action. Keeping requires nothing. The default — doing nothing — means you keep paying. Companies know this. It's why free trials auto-convert and cancellation flows are deliberately complicated. (Looking at you, every gym membership ever.)

**The sunk cost fallacy.** "I've already paid for 6 months, so I should keep using it." No. The money is gone regardless. The only question is whether you want to keep spending going forward.

The whole subscription economy is built on the bet that you'll sign up in a moment of enthusiasm and forget to cancel when the enthusiasm fades. For the average consumer, that bet pays off handsomely — for the companies.

## How do you prevent subscription creep going forward?

**Rule 1: Wait 48 hours before subscribing to anything.** The free trial impulse is powerful. If you still want it two days later, go for it. Most of the time, you won't.

**Rule 2: Do a quarterly subscription audit.** Every three months, spend 15 minutes reviewing your subscriptions. It's like cleaning the fridge — if you do it regularly, nothing gets too disgusting.

**Rule 3: Use a dedicated card for subscriptions.** Put all subscriptions on a single credit card. Your monthly statement becomes an automatic subscription list. Any charge on that card you don't recognize gets investigated immediately.

**Rule 4: Set a subscription budget.** Decide in advance: "I'll spend no more than $X/month on subscriptions." When a new one comes in, an old one has to go. This forces the tradeoff that subscription companies desperately want you to avoid making.

Most budgeting apps, including [Thallo](https://usethallo.com), automatically identify and flag recurring charges so you can see your total subscription spending in one view. This alone makes the audit process take minutes instead of an hour.

## Is subscription fatigue real?

Yes. A 2025 survey found that 55% of Americans feel overwhelmed by the number of subscriptions they manage. This is driving a real trend: people are actively consolidating and reducing their subscription count.

The companies have noticed. Bundle deals are everywhere now — Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+, Apple One, Amazon Prime's creeping bundle of everything. Bundles can be cost-effective if you'd pay for 2+ of the included services anyway. But they're also a retention tactic — you keep the bundle for the one thing you use, which means you're paying for five things you don't.

Evaluate bundles the same way you evaluate individual subscriptions: would you pay for each component separately? If you'd only pay for two of the five services in a bundle, check if those two cost less individually.

## FAQ

### How much does the average American spend on subscriptions?
The average American spends approximately $273 per month ($3,276 per year) on subscriptions, including streaming services, software, fitness memberships, delivery services, and financial tools. Most people underestimate their subscription spending by 60-70%.

### How do I find all my subscriptions?
Review 3 months of bank and credit card statements for recurring charges, search your email for "receipt" and "renewal" confirmations, and check your Apple App Store or Google Play subscription settings. Annual subscriptions are the easiest to miss — they charge once and disappear from your mental accounting.

### What subscriptions should I cancel first?
Cancel subscriptions you haven't used in 30+ days first. Then eliminate redundant services in the same category (multiple streaming platforms, overlapping cloud storage, duplicate news subscriptions). Finally, evaluate whether remaining subscriptions justify their cost versus free alternatives.

### How often should I audit my subscriptions?
Audit your subscriptions quarterly (every 3 months). Set a recurring calendar reminder. Each audit should take 15-20 minutes if you use a dedicated credit card for subscriptions or a budgeting app that flags recurring charges automatically.

### Are subscription bundles worth it?
Bundles (like Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ or Apple One) are worth it only if you would independently pay for at least 2-3 of the included services. If you're keeping the bundle for one service while ignoring the rest, compare the bundle price to the individual service cost — the standalone option is often cheaper.
