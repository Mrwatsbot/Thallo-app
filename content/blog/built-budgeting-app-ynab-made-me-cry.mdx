I didn't build a budgeting app because I loved budgeting. I built it because I closed a credit card I didn't need, and my credit score tanked 60 points overnight.

Let me be clear: I did nothing wrong. The card had a zero balance. I had perfect payment history. I just didn't need it anymore, so I called and closed it. Responsible financial behavior, right?

Wrong. My FICO score dropped from 742 to 682. My credit utilization ratio spiked because I had less available credit. My average account age dropped. And when I tried to get the *same card* back a year later — still with perfect payment history, same income, same everything — I was declined.

That's when I realized: **the system is broken.**

You can make every "correct" financial decision and still get punished because the metrics we use to measure financial health are fundamentally flawed. Your credit score doesn't care if you have six months of emergency savings. It doesn't care if you're debt-free. It cares about whether you're a profitable customer for lenders. That's it.

I'm an economics major. I work in analytics. I understand how these systems work — and that's exactly why I couldn't accept that this was the best we could do.

## The spreadsheet that changed everything

Around the same time, my fiancée was drowning in student loan payments. She'd built this incredibly detailed spreadsheet tracking every loan, every interest rate, every payment schedule. We're talking multiple tabs, color-coded cells, formulas calculating interest over time. It was impressive — and completely unsustainable.

So we used AI to figure out the optimal payoff strategy. Plugged in all her numbers, let it run the math on avalanche vs. snowball, minimum payments vs. aggressive payoff, opportunity cost of extra payments vs. investing. It gave us a clear answer in about 30 seconds.

That's when it hit me: **with all the technology we have today, why are we still using spreadsheets for this?**

She'd spent hours building something that technology should have just... done. Automatically. Without thinking about it.

## We talked about budgeting. We never actually budgeted.

Here's the embarrassing part: we talked about building a budget all the time. "We should really set up a budget." "We need to figure out our spending." "Let's sit down this weekend and create categories."

We never did it.

Not because we were lazy. Not because we didn't care. But because the friction between "we should budget" and "we are actively budgeting" felt insurmountable. Setting up categories. Linking accounts. Learning whatever system the app wanted us to follow. Doing the manual work of tracking and categorizing and reconciling.

The gap between intention and action was enormous, and every budgeting app I researched seemed designed to make that gap bigger, not smaller.

## Why existing tools don't work (and I never used them)

I want to be upfront: I never used YNAB. I never used Mint. I never signed up for Monarch Money or Copilot or any of the "big" budgeting apps. But I researched the hell out of them, and here's what I saw:

**YNAB's problem:** The methodology is brilliant. Give every dollar a job. Embrace true expenses. The philosophy is rock-solid. But the execution demands hours of manual bookkeeping every week. The subreddit is full of people who feel like failures because they "fell off the wagon" after a few months. The people who succeed with YNAB *really* succeed — but there's a much larger group who try it, feel overwhelmed, and quietly quit. And those people are told that if YNAB didn't work for them, it's a personal failing. That felt wrong to me.

**Monarch Money's problem:** It's a beautiful financial mirror. Gorgeous net worth dashboard, great for couples, syncs everything. But it shows you what happened without telling you what to do next. You see that you spent $2,200 on food last month and think... "Okay. Now what?" The app doesn't suggest where to cut. Doesn't help you optimize. It just reflects your financial life back at you and charges $99/year for the privilege.

The pattern I kept seeing: these tools either demanded tons of manual work (YNAB) or passively reported data without actionable guidance (Monarch). Nobody was building something that met people where they actually are.

## What if technology actually helped?

My econ background gave me a framework for thinking about this differently. In economics, we talk about **revealed preferences** — people's actual behavior reveals what they value more than what they say they value.

Everyone *says* they want to budget. Very few people *actually* budget. That's not a discipline problem. That's a design problem.

The revealed preference is clear: people want the outcome of budgeting (financial stability, savings, less stress) without the tedious process of budgeting (categorizing transactions, reconciling accounts, manual data entry).

So I started building [Thallo](https://usethallo.com) with one core question: **What if the app did the tedious parts so you could focus on the decisions that actually matter?**

- **Categorization?** AI handles it automatically.
- **Budget adjustments?** The algorithm suggests optimal rebalancing.
- **Spending patterns?** Machine learning spots them before you do.
- **Debt payoff strategy?** AI calculates the optimal path instantly.

Not because people are lazy. Because human attention is finite and valuable, and spending it on manual bookkeeping is a waste when technology can do it better.

## The Financial Health Score: 0 to 1,000

The other thing that bothered me about every budgeting app: the obsession with monthly budget compliance. Did you stay under budget? Gold star. Did you overspend? Shame on you.

But that's such a myopic view of financial health. You could nail your monthly budget for six months and still be financially fragile if you have no emergency fund, crushing debt, and zero retirement savings.

I wanted a single number that captured the whole picture. Not "did you spend less than you earned this month" but "are you building genuine financial stability?"

Thallo's Financial Health Score is measured on a **0 to 1,000 scale** across three pillars:

**Trajectory (400 points max)**
- Are you moving in the right direction?
- Is your net worth increasing over time?
- Are you on track for long-term goals (retirement, home purchase)?

**Behavior (350 points max)**
- Are you making good financial decisions day-to-day?
- Do you stick to your budget?
- Are you building positive money habits?

**Position (250 points max)**
- Where do you stand right now?
- Do you have an emergency fund?
- What's your debt-to-income ratio?
- Are you saving enough?

Your credit score — the number that actually affects your ability to rent apartments and get loans — doesn't look at any of this. Someone with $200,000 in savings and zero debt can have the same FICO score as someone drowning in minimum payments.

That's broken. So we built something better.

## Why free?

This was the easiest decision I made.

If you're struggling financially — the exact people who need budgeting tools most — charging $99-$109/year is insulting. "Hey, you're bad with money? Pay us to tell you about it."

[Thallo](https://usethallo.com) has a **free tier** because budgeting shouldn't have a cover charge. The free version includes:
- Financial Health Score (full 0-1,000 scale)
- Budget tracking
- Debt & savings goals
- CSV import
- Basic streak tracking

It's not a demo. It's not crippled. It's a real tool that helps you budget without extracting money from people who need it most.

**Plus ($79/year)** adds the AI layer:
- AI-powered insights
- Auto budget wizard
- "Can I afford this?" feature
- Receipt scanning
- AI coaching
- Gamification features

Note: Plus doesn't include bank sync. That's intentional. Some people prefer the privacy and control of manual entry, and the AI features work great with CSV imports.

**Pro ($149/year)** is the full package:
- Everything in Plus
- Bank sync
- Unlimited AI usage
- Advanced analytics

If the free version helps you get your finances together and you never pay us a cent, that's a genuine win. I'd rather have a million free users who actually budget than a hundred thousand paying users who quit after three months.

## What building this taught me

The biggest obstacle to budgeting isn't motivation or knowledge — **it's friction.**

People know they should budget. They know roughly what to do. What stops them is:
- The 45 minutes of setup
- The daily categorization homework
- The guilt when they fall behind
- The feeling of failure when they can't maintain the system

Remove that friction and most people will engage with their finances. Not because they're gamified into it. Not because an app shamed them into action. But because the distance between "I want to budget" and "I am actively budgeting" is finally short enough to actually cross.

My fiancée and I used to talk about budgeting constantly and never do it. Now we check Thallo a few times a week, make adjustments when the AI flags something, and spend our mental energy on actual financial decisions instead of spreadsheet maintenance.

That's what I wanted to build. Not a more powerful spreadsheet. Not a more judgmental task manager. Just a tool that actually helps.

## The honest pitch

I built Thallo, so obviously I'm biased. Take everything I say with appropriate skepticism.

If YNAB's manual approach clicks with you and you enjoy the practice of budgeting, use YNAB. It works incredibly well for the people it works for.

If you want a beautiful financial dashboard and you're a couple, Monarch Money is genuinely excellent at showing your complete financial picture.

If you want something that meets you where you are, automates the tedious parts, and doesn't charge you to get started — that's what Thallo is for.

The best budgeting app is the one you actually use. For me and my fiancée, spreadsheets and endless budgeting conversations weren't cutting it. Maybe they work for you. No judgment either way.

## FAQ

### Why did Ted build Thallo?
Ted built Thallo after his credit score tanked when he responsibly closed an unused credit card — revealing how broken traditional financial metrics are. Watching his fiancée struggle with student loan spreadsheets and realizing they talked about budgeting constantly but never actually did it made him see the gap: existing tools demand too much manual work or provide data without actionable guidance. As an econ major working in analytics, he saw an opportunity to build something that automates the tedious parts so people can focus on decisions that matter.

### Did Ted ever use YNAB or other budgeting apps?
No. Ted researched YNAB, Monarch Money, and other popular apps extensively but never personally used them. His critiques are based on observation and analysis of how these tools work, not personal experience. YNAB's manual bookkeeping approach and Monarch's passive reporting style didn't solve the core problem: reducing friction between wanting to budget and actually budgeting.

### What is Thallo's Financial Health Score?
Thallo's Financial Health Score is a 0-1,000 rating that measures overall financial wellbeing across three pillars: **Trajectory** (400 points - are you moving in the right direction?), **Behavior** (350 points - are you making good decisions?), and **Position** (250 points - where do you stand now?). Unlike credit scores, it reflects whether you're building genuine financial stability, not just whether you're profitable to lenders.

### Is Thallo really free?
Yes. The free tier includes the full Financial Health Score, budget tracking, debt & savings goals, CSV import, and basic streaks. It's not a trial or demo — it's a complete budgeting tool. Paid plans (Plus at $79/year, Pro at $149/year) add AI features, bank sync, and advanced analytics. If you never upgrade, that's fine — the free version is designed to genuinely help.

### What makes Thallo different from other budgeting apps?
Thallo automates the tedious parts (categorization, pattern recognition, optimization suggestions) so you can focus on financial decisions rather than bookkeeping. It measures holistic financial health (0-1,000 score) instead of just monthly budget compliance. And it offers a real free tier because budgeting shouldn't cost money for people who need it most.
