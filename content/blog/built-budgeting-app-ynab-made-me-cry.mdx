Okay, YNAB didn't literally make me cry. But there was a moment — 11pm on a Tuesday, three weeks into using it — where I was sitting on my couch reconciling transactions and thought: "I am spending my free time doing accounting. This is not what I signed up for."

I'd started using YNAB because I was 28, making decent money as a software engineer, and had absolutely no idea where it went each month. My rent was $1,650. My student loans were $487/month. Beyond that? A mystery. I knew I wasn't saving enough. I knew I should be investing. I was pretty sure I was spending too much on food. But I had no numbers to back up any of those feelings.

YNAB promised to fix that. And to be fair, it did — for about six weeks.

## What went wrong with YNAB?

Let me be clear: YNAB's *methodology* is excellent. Give every dollar a job. Embrace your true expenses. Roll with the punches. Age your money. These are genuinely smart principles, and if you follow them, you will get better with money.

The problem was everything else.

I spent my first weekend setting up categories. YNAB wants you to create categories for everything — and I mean everything. Rent. Electric. Gas. Water. Internet. Phone. Groceries. Dining out. Coffee (separate from dining out, apparently). Clothing. Household goods. Personal care. Medical. Auto insurance. Gas (car, not stove — see how this gets confusing?). Subscriptions. Gifts. Entertainment.

I had 34 categories by the time I was done, and I immediately felt overwhelmed. Every transaction that came in needed to be reviewed, categorized, and reconciled against my budget. Miss a few days? You're now looking at a backlog of 15-20 transactions to sort through.

But the real killer was the concept of "overspending." When you overspend in a YNAB category, you have to "cover" it by pulling money from another category. The first time I went $47 over on dining out, I spent 20 minutes deciding which categories to steal from. Groceries? Clothing? My "fun money" category? It felt like financial Sophie's Choice, and the stakes were $47.

I lasted two months. Then I stopped opening the app. Then I cancelled. Then my autopay renewed for $99 (this was before the price hike to $109) because I'd forgotten to cancel before the annual renewal.

The irony of losing $99 because I forgot to cancel a budgeting app was not lost on me.

## Was it just me?

I assumed I was the problem. Discipline issue. Not committed enough. Classic case of blaming the tool instead of the user.

Then I started talking to friends. My buddy Jake: "I used YNAB for three months and quit. Too much manual work." My coworker Sarah: "I love the idea of YNAB but I can't keep up with it." My sister: "I downloaded it, looked at the setup, and deleted it."

I started poking around online. Turns out, the YNAB subreddit — which I genuinely love for its enthusiasm — also has a constant stream of posts from people who feel like failures because they can't maintain the system. "Fell off the wagon." "Starting over... again." "Is it normal to spend 2 hours a week on this?"

The people who succeed with YNAB *really* succeed. They swear by it. They evangelize it. But there's a much larger, quieter group who try it, feel inadequate, and quietly walk away. And those people — my people — were being told that the only way to budget was to spend hours doing manual bookkeeping.

That felt wrong to me.

## What if the app did the hard parts?

I'm an engineer. When I encounter a tedious manual process, my brain immediately goes to: "How do I automate this?"

The categorization? AI can do that. Transaction matching? Pattern recognition. Budget adjustments when you overspend? An algorithm can suggest optimal rebalancing in milliseconds. Spotting spending patterns? Machine learning eats that for breakfast.

I started sketching Thallo on a weekend in March 2024. The core idea was simple: **what if your budgeting app was smart enough to do the bookkeeping for you, so you could focus on the actual decisions?**

Not a replacement for financial discipline — you still have to make good choices. But what if the *mechanics* of budgeting required 5 minutes a week instead of 2 hours?

## What about Monarch Money?

Before I committed to building something, I tried Monarch Money. It's a genuinely beautiful app. The net worth dashboard is better than anything else on the market. For couples, the sharing features are excellent.

But Monarch is a financial *mirror*, not a financial *coach*. It shows you what happened. It tells you where your money went. It makes nice charts. What it doesn't do is help you figure out what to do *next*.

I opened Monarch, saw that I'd spent $2,200 on food the previous month, and thought... "Okay. Now what?" The app didn't tell me what a good target was. Didn't suggest where to cut. Didn't point out that my $14.99 meal kit subscription was the most expensive protein per serving in my diet. It just showed me numbers and let me marinate in mild financial guilt.

Also, $99/year. For a dashboard.

## Why I built the Financial Health Score

The other thing that bugged me about every budgeting app was the obsession with monthly budget compliance. Did you stay under budget this month? Gold star. Did you overspend? Red marks everywhere.

But that's such a narrow view of financial health. You could nail your monthly budget for six months and still be financially fragile if you have no emergency fund, $45,000 in student debt, and zero retirement savings.

I wanted a single number that captured the whole picture. Not just "did you spend less than you earned this month" but "are you building a financially healthy life?"

The Financial Health Score in Thallo looks at:

- **Savings rate** — Are you saving at least 15-20% of your income?
- **Emergency fund coverage** — Do you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside?
- **Debt-to-income ratio** — Is your total debt manageable relative to your earnings?
- **Budget adherence** — Are you consistently spending within your plan?
- **Net worth trajectory** — Is your net worth moving in the right direction over time?

Your credit score (you know, the number that actually matters in the real world for getting apartments and loans) doesn't look at any of these things. A person with $200,000 in savings and zero debt can have the same credit score as someone drowning in credit card payments who happens to make their minimums on time.

That felt broken. So we built something better.

## Why free?

This was the easiest decision I made. If you're struggling financially — the exact people who need a budgeting tool most — charging $99-$109/year is an insult. "Hey, you're bad with money? Pay us $9 a month to tell you about it."

[Thallo](https://usethallo.com) has a free tier because budgeting shouldn't have a cover charge. The free version includes bank syncing, basic budgeting, transaction tracking, and the Financial Health Score. It's not a crippled demo. It's a real tool.

The paid tiers ($49-$99/year) exist for people who want the full AI experience — smart categorization, predictive insights, spending pattern analysis, optimization suggestions. If the free version helps you get your finances together and you never pay us a dime, that's a genuine win. I'd rather have a million free users who actually budget than a hundred thousand paying users who quit after three months.

## What have I learned building this?

Building a budgeting app taught me something counterintuitive: **the biggest obstacle to budgeting isn't motivation or knowledge — it's friction.**

People know they should budget. They know roughly what to do. What stops them is the 45 minutes of setup, the daily categorization homework, the guilt when they don't keep up. Remove the friction and most people will engage with their finances.

That's the bet Thallo is making. Not that people are lazy. Not that they need gamification or social features or AI to think for them. Just that the gap between "I want to budget" and "I am actively budgeting" is mostly mechanical, and technology should close it.

If YNAB's philosophy is "budgeting is a practice," Thallo's philosophy is "budgeting is a result." I don't care if you spend 5 minutes or 5 hours in the app. I care whether your Financial Health Score is going up.

## Isn't this biased?

Obviously. I built Thallo, so take everything I say with appropriate skepticism. I've tried to be fair about what YNAB and Monarch do well — and they do many things well.

Here's my honest recommendation: if YNAB's approach clicks with you, use YNAB. It's the most proven methodology in personal finance software. If you want a beautiful financial dashboard and you're a couple, use Monarch Money. If you want something that meets you where you are, does the tedious work for you, and doesn't charge you for the privilege of getting started — give Thallo a shot.

The best budgeting app is the one you actually use. For me, that wasn't YNAB at 11pm on a Tuesday. Maybe it is for you. No judgment either way.

## FAQ

### Why did Ted Melittas build Thallo?
Ted built Thallo after frustrating experiences with YNAB (too much manual work) and Monarch Money (financial dashboard without actionable guidance). The goal was a budgeting app that uses AI to handle the tedious parts of budgeting while focusing on holistic financial health rather than just monthly budget compliance.

### Is Thallo better than YNAB?
It depends on your style. YNAB is better for people who want hands-on, manual control over every dollar and are willing to invest 1-2 hours per week in the practice. Thallo is better for people who want AI to handle categorization and optimization so they can focus on decisions rather than data entry.

### Does Thallo have a free plan?
Yes. Thallo's free tier includes bank account syncing, basic budgeting, transaction tracking, and the Financial Health Score. There's no time limit. Paid plans ($49–$99/year) add AI-powered insights and advanced analytics.

### What is a Financial Health Score?
Thallo's Financial Health Score is a 0-100 rating that measures your overall financial wellbeing across five dimensions: savings rate, emergency fund coverage, debt-to-income ratio, budget adherence, and net worth trajectory. Unlike a credit score, it reflects whether you're building genuine financial stability.
