# Best Free Budgeting Apps in 2026 (Honest Rankings)

Most "free" budgeting apps are about as free as a timeshare presentation. Sure, you can download them without paying, but good luck actually using the useful features without upgrading to Premium Plus Gold Diamond tier for $14.99/month.

I tested 23 budgeting apps over the last three months. Here are the ones that are actually useful without paying, ranked by how much you can do before hitting a paywall.

**Spoiler:** There's no perfect free app. They all make money somehow. The question is whether the free tier is useful or just a demo.

## The Actually Free Tier: Mint (RIP, Sort Of)

**Mint** was the king of free budgeting apps for 15 years. Then Intuit killed it in 2024 and tried to force everyone to Credit Karma.

Credit Karma has budgeting features now, but it's not the same. It's clearly designed to sell you credit cards and loans, not help you budget.

If you were a Mint user, I'm sorry. That one hurt.

**Verdict:** Gone but not forgotten. Pour one out.

## Tier 1: Actually Good For Free

### Thallo (Free tier + paid options)

Look, I built this app, so take this with a grain of salt. But we genuinely have a useful free tier.

**What's free:**
- Unlimited account connections
- Transaction categorization (AI-powered)
- Basic budgeting tools
- Financial Health Score
- Mobile app

**What costs money ($49-99/year):**
- Advanced AI insights
- Custom budget templates
- Goal tracking with projections
- Priority support

**Why it's good:** We're not trying to sell you credit cards or loans. The free tier isn't crippled—it's actually useful for basic budgeting. The paid features are genuinely extra, not "the app doesn't work without this."

**Why it's not perfect:** We're newer, so we don't have 10 years of feature bloat (yet). If you want every bell and whistle, established apps have more.

**Best for:** People who want AI help with categorization and a Financial Health Score beyond just tracking expenses.

### Goodbudget (Free tier + paid upgrade)

**What's free:**
- Manual envelope budgeting (you enter transactions yourself)
- 20 envelopes (budget categories)
- 1 account
- Works on web and mobile

**What costs money ($10/month or $80/year):**
- Unlimited envelopes
- 5+ accounts
- Automatic transaction import
- 5 years of transaction history

**Why it's good:** If you like envelope budgeting and don't mind manual entry, this is solid. The free tier isn't artificially limited just to upsell you.

**Why it's not perfect:** Manual entry is annoying. In 2026, people expect apps to pull transactions automatically.

**Best for:** People who want to try envelope budgeting without committing to paid software, or who prefer manual control.

### EveryDollar (Free tier + Ramsey+ paid)

**What's free:**
- Zero-based budgeting framework
- Manual transaction tracking
- Monthly budget planning
- Debt payoff tracking

**What costs money ($79.99/year with Ramsey+):**
- Bank account connection
- Automatic transaction import
- Custom reports

**Why it's good:** If you follow Dave Ramsey's advice (which is solid for getting out of debt), this app matches his system perfectly. The free tier is functional.

**Why it's not perfect:** Manual entry only for free tier. Also, Dave Ramsey is... polarizing. If you don't vibe with his style, you won't vibe with this app.

**Best for:** Dave Ramsey fans or anyone doing debt payoff who doesn't mind manual entry.

## Tier 2: Free But Limited

### Rocket Money (Free with aggressive upsells)

**What's free:**
- See all your accounts in one place
- Track subscriptions
- Basic budgeting
- Net worth tracking

**What costs money ($4-12/month, negotiable):**
- Subscription cancellation service
- Bill negotiation
- Smart savings
- Credit score monitoring

**Why it's on this list:** The free tier is actually usable for basic tracking. The subscription finder is helpful even on free.

**Why it's not great:** The app is constantly trying to upsell you. Every screen has a "upgrade to premium" prompt. It gets old fast.

**Best for:** People who want to find and cancel subscriptions, or who don't mind aggressive upselling.

### PocketGuard (Free tier + paid)

**What's free:**
- Link 2 bank accounts
- Track spending
- "In My Pocket" feature (shows available spending money)
- Basic budgets

**What costs money ($12.99/month or $74.99/year):**
- Unlimited accounts
- Debt payoff plan
- Export transactions
- Custom categories

**Why it's on this list:** The "In My Pocket" feature is clever—it shows you how much you can spend after bills and savings goals. That's useful.

**Why it's not great:** 2 accounts is not enough for most people. If you have checking, savings, and one credit card, you're already at the limit.

**Best for:** People with simple finances (1-2 accounts) who want a quick view of available spending money.

### Simplifi by Quicken (Free trial, then $47.99/year)

Wait, this isn't free. Why is it here?

**Full transparency:** Simplifi has a 30-day free trial, but then it's paid. I'm including it because $47.99/year is cheaper than most "free" apps if you use the paid tier.

If you're going to pay for budgeting software, Simplifi is worth considering over apps with $10-15/month subscriptions.

**Best for:** People who know they want paid software and are choosing between options.

## Tier 3: "Free" As A Technicality

### Credit Karma (Free but you're the product)

**What's free:**
- Everything, technically
- Credit score monitoring
- Account linking
- Budget tracking
- Net worth calculator

**The catch:** You're shown personalized credit card and loan offers constantly. The whole app is designed to funnel you toward financial products.

**Why it's on this list:** It's free and it works. But you're not the customer, you're the inventory.

**Why it's annoying:** Every feature comes with a side of "here's a credit card offer." Want to check your budget? Cool, but first, have you considered this 18% APR card?

**Best for:** People who want free credit monitoring and don't mind being sold to constantly, or who have impulse control around financial offers.

### NerdWallet (Free, same model as Credit Karma)

Same as Credit Karma but with more articles. The budgeting features are fine, but the real business model is affiliate commissions on credit cards and loans.

**Best for:** People who want financial content alongside their budgeting app.

## Apps That Pretend To Be Free But Aren't

These apps advertise "free" but are essentially unusable without paying:

### Monarch Money
14-day free trial, then $99/year. The "free trial" is just a demo. Don't fall for it.

(Monarch is actually great if you pay for it, but it's not a free app.)

### YNAB (You Need A Budget)
34-day free trial, then $109/year. Same deal. Excellent app, not free.

### Copilot Money
14-day free trial, then $119/year. iOS only. Very polished, very much not free.

## Comparison Table: What's Actually Free

| App | Auto-Import | Accounts | Budgeting Method | Biggest Catch |
|-----|------------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Thallo** | ✅ Yes | Unlimited | Flexible | AI features limited on free |
| **Goodbudget** | ❌ No | 1 | Envelope | Manual entry only |
| **EveryDollar** | ❌ No | Unlimited | Zero-based | Manual entry only |
| **Rocket Money** | ✅ Yes | Unlimited | Basic | Constant upsell prompts |
| **PocketGuard** | ✅ Yes | 2 max | In My Pocket | Only 2 accounts free |
| **Credit Karma** | ✅ Yes | Unlimited | Basic | You're the product |

## Which One Should You Actually Use?

**If you want zero-based budgeting:** Start with EveryDollar (free) or pay for YNAB ($109/year) if you're serious.

**If you want envelope budgeting:** Goodbudget free tier, or pay for Goodbudget Plus ($80/year).

**If you want AI help and modern features:** Thallo (free tier is solid, paid tier is $49-99/year).

**If you want to find and cancel subscriptions:** Rocket Money, but prepare for upsell fatigue.

**If you want truly free and don't care about being sold to:** Credit Karma works.

**If you have simple finances (1-2 accounts):** PocketGuard is fine for free.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Free Apps

Free apps make money somehow. Usually it's one of these:

1. **Freemium model:** Free tier is limited, paid tier is where the real features live (Thallo, Goodbudget, PocketGuard)
2. **Advertising and affiliate commissions:** You're shown credit card offers and loan products (Credit Karma, NerdWallet)
3. **Free trial that converts to paid:** Not actually free (Monarch, YNAB, Copilot)
4. **Data monetization:** Your financial data is anonymized and sold (varies by app, read the privacy policy)

There's no such thing as a free lunch. The question is whether the trade-off is worth it.

Personally, I'd rather pay $50/year for an app that works than use a "free" app that's constantly trying to sell me a 22% APR credit card. But that's just me.

## My Actual Recommendation

Try a few free tiers and see what fits:

**Week 1:** Try Thallo or Credit Karma (automatic import, full features)
**Week 2:** Try EveryDollar or Goodbudget (manual entry, envelope/zero-based budgeting)
**Week 3:** Decide if you need paid features or if free works

Most people find that:
- If you want automatic import, you'll probably end up paying $50-100/year somewhere
- If you're okay with manual entry, you can stay free forever
- If you're willing to be sold credit products, Credit Karma is fine

Pick the model that fits your life and budget. The best budgeting app is the one you'll actually use.

## FAQ

**Q: Why isn't Mint on this list?**
A: Intuit shut down Mint in March 2024. It's gone. Credit Karma is the "replacement," but it's not the same app.

**Q: Are paid budgeting apps worth it?**
A: If you're serious about budgeting and will use it consistently, yes. $100/year for software that helps you save $500/month is a 60x return. But you have to actually use it.

**Q: Can I switch apps without losing data?**
A: Depends on the app. Most let you export transactions as CSV files. Some let you import from other apps. Check before committing.

**Q: What about spreadsheets? Can't I just use Excel?**
A: Absolutely. A spreadsheet is free and works great if you're disciplined about updating it. The downside is manual work—no automatic transaction import, no mobile app, no AI categorization. But it's free and flexible.

**Q: Do any free apps work without linking bank accounts?**
A: Yes. Goodbudget and EveryDollar (free tier) let you track manually without connecting accounts. This is actually more secure if you're worried about data breaches, but way more work.
