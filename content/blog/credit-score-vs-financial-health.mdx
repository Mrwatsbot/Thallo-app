# What Your Credit Score Doesn't Tell You About Your Financial Health

Your credit score is 780. Congrats! You're doing great, right?

Maybe. Or maybe you're drowning in debt, have $200 in savings, and panic every time an unexpected bill shows up.

I've met people with pristine credit scores who are one emergency away from financial collapse. And I've met people with mediocre scores who sleep soundly because they've got their money sorted.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **your credit score measures how profitable you are to lenders, not how financially healthy you are.**

## What Does Your Credit Score Actually Measure?

Your credit score (FICO or VantageScore) tracks five things:
- **Payment history (35%)** - Do you pay bills on time?
- **Credit utilization (30%)** - How much of your available credit are you using?
- **Length of credit history (15%)** - How long have you had credit accounts?
- **New credit (10%)** - Have you opened new accounts recently?
- **Credit mix (10%)** - Do you have different types of credit?

Notice what's missing? Your income. Your savings. Your expenses. Your net worth. Whether you can afford your lifestyle.

A credit score is a great tool for lenders deciding if they'll make money off you. It's a terrible tool for measuring if you're actually okay.

## You Can Have Great Credit While Being Broke

Here's how this happens all the time:

**Scenario 1: The Minimum Payment Champion**
- Makes $75,000/year
- Has $45,000 in credit card debt across five cards
- Pays every minimum payment on time, every month
- Credit utilization looks fine because they keep opening new cards
- Credit score: 760

The credit bureaus love this person. They're reliable. Predictable. Profitable.

But this person is paying $800+/month just in interest. They can't save. They can't invest. One job loss would be catastrophic.

**Scenario 2: The Car Lease Cycle**
- Leases a new car every three years
- Always makes payments on time
- Also has a mortgage and pays it religiously
- Credit score: 810

Looks great on paper. But they're spending $650/month on a depreciating asset they'll never own. After 10 years of $7,800/year in car payments, they have nothing to show for it.

**The pattern:** You can have excellent credit while making terrible financial decisions.

## What Credit Scores Completely Ignore

### Your Emergency Fund (or Lack Thereof)

60% of Americans couldn't cover a $1,000 emergency without borrowing or selling something. Your credit score doesn't care if you're in that 60%.

You could have an 800 credit score and $0 in savings. The first medical bill, car repair, or job loss would force you to go into debt.

**What actually matters:** 3-6 months of expenses in a savings account you can access immediately.

### Your Debt-to-Income Ratio

This is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward debt payments. Lenders look at this when you apply for a mortgage, but it's not in your credit score.

- Below 20%: You're probably fine
- 20-36%: You're managing, but not much room for error
- Above 36%: You're in dangerous territory

Someone making $50,000/year with $1,500/month in debt payments ($18,000/year) has a 36% DTI. They might have good credit, but they're stretched thin.

### Your Net Worth Trajectory

Are you building wealth or just treading water?

Two people with 750 credit scores:
- **Person A:** $200K salary, $180K in student loans, $50K car lease, $15K in retirement savings at age 35
- **Person B:** $60K salary, no debt, $80K in retirement savings, owns a used car at age 35

Person B is crushing it. Person A is a high-earning broke person with great credit.

### Your Savings Rate

The single best predictor of long-term financial health is simple: what percentage of your income do you save and invest?

- 5-10%: You're doing better than most, but it'll be a long road
- 15-20%: You're building real wealth
- 25%+: You're on track to financial independence

Your credit score has no idea if you save 2% or 40% of your income.

## Real Financial Health: A Better Scorecard

If credit scores won't tell you the truth, what should you measure instead?

### The Financial Health Score

When I built Thallo, I got frustrated with how people obsess over credit scores while ignoring metrics that actually matter. So we built a Financial Health Score that looks at:

1. **Emergency fund coverage** (months of expenses saved)
2. **Debt burden** (debt payments vs. income)
3. **Spending efficiency** (are you living below your means?)
4. **Savings trajectory** (are you building wealth?)
5. **Financial stability** (income volatility, irregular expenses)

It's not about what lenders want to see. It's about whether you can sleep at night.

### The Questions That Actually Matter

Answer these honestly:

**Can you cover a $5,000 emergency without going into debt?**
If no, your financial health is fragile regardless of your credit score.

**Are you saving at least 15% of your gross income?**
If no, you're not building long-term security.

**Could you survive 3 months without income?**
If no, you're one layoff away from crisis mode.

**Is your net worth increasing every year?**
If no, you're working hard but not making progress.

**Do you know where your money goes each month?**
If no, you're flying blind.

These questions tell you more about your financial health than any three-digit score.

## When Credit Scores Do Matter

I'm not saying credit scores are worthless. They absolutely matter when you're:
- Buying a house (affects your mortgage rate significantly)
- Leasing an apartment (some landlords have minimum score requirements)
- Getting a car loan (can save you thousands in interest)
- Sometimes getting a job (certain industries check credit)

A good credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars in interest over your lifetime. That's real money.

But it's one tool in the toolbox, not the whole workshop.

## Building Both: Credit Score and Actual Financial Health

The good news? Most things that improve your real financial health also improve your credit score.

**Pay yourself first, then pay your bills.**
Set up automatic transfers to savings the day you get paid. What's left over goes to expenses and debt payments (which you make on time).

**Keep credit utilization under 30%, but aim for under 10%.**
Better yet, pay off your full balance every month. Good for your score, great for your wallet.

**Don't close old credit cards.**
They help your length of credit history. Just don't use them to justify spending money you don't have.

**Focus on net worth, not credit limits.**
Your credit card company increasing your limit to $25,000 doesn't make you richer. Putting $25,000 in investments does.

## The Bottom Line

Your credit score is like your car's speedometer. Useful information, but it doesn't tell you if you're headed in the right direction or if you have enough gas to get there.

Real financial health is about freedom, not numbers. It's about choices, not obligations.

It's being able to say "yes" to opportunities because you have savings, not because you have available credit.

It's about building a life where you control your money, not the other way around.

Check your credit score a couple times a year. But check your savings rate, your emergency fund, and your net worth every month.

That's the scorecard that actually matters.

## FAQ

**Q: What's a good credit score?**
A: 670-739 is "good," 740-799 is "very good," and 800+ is "exceptional." But remember, 760 and 820 get you basically the same interest rates for most loans. Chasing perfection isn't worth it.

**Q: Can I have good financial health with a low credit score?**
A: Absolutely. If you have no debt, 6 months of expenses saved, and invest 20% of your income, you're financially healthy even with a 650 credit score. Though you should work on improving it to save money on future loans.

**Q: How often should I check my credit score?**
A: Every 3-6 months is plenty unless you're about to apply for a mortgage or major loan. You can check for free at AnnualCreditReport.com or through most banking apps.

**Q: What's more important: paying off debt or building savings?**
A: Both matter, but generally: save $1,000 for emergencies first, then attack high-interest debt (above 6-7%), while maintaining minimum payments on everything else. Once high-interest debt is gone, split your efforts between building a full emergency fund and paying off remaining debt.

**Q: How do I calculate my net worth?**
A: Assets (savings, investments, home equity, vehicle value) minus liabilities (all debts). If you're young and just starting out, a negative net worth isn't unusual. What matters is the trend: is it going up each year?
