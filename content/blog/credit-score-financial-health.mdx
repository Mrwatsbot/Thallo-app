A person with a 780 credit score can be broke. A person with a 650 credit score can have $200,000 in savings.

This isn't a hypothetical — it happens constantly. Credit scores measure how reliably you repay borrowed money. They say nothing about how much money you have, how much you save, whether you could survive a job loss, or whether you're on track for retirement.

And yet, we treat the credit score like it's the SAT of personal finance. One number to rule them all.

It's not. Here's what it actually measures — and everything it misses.

## What does your credit score actually measure?

The FICO score, used in 90% of lending decisions, weighs five factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Payment history | 35% | Did you pay your bills on time? |
| Credit utilization | 30% | How much of your available credit are you using? |
| Length of credit history | 15% | How long have your accounts been open? |
| Credit mix | 10% | Do you have different types of credit? |
| New credit inquiries | 10% | Have you applied for credit recently? |

Notice what's not on this list: your income. Your savings. Your net worth. Your debt-to-income ratio. Your retirement contributions. Whether you have health insurance. Whether you could cover a $1,000 emergency without borrowing.

Your credit score is a **borrowing report card**. It tells lenders whether you're likely to repay a loan. That's useful information for a bank deciding whether to give you a mortgage. It's nearly useless for understanding your actual financial health.

## How can someone have a high credit score and be financially unhealthy?

Meet a profile I see all the time: 32 years old, earns $85,000, credit score of 760. Sounds great on paper. But:

- $62,000 in student loans
- $0 in emergency savings
- $3,200 in credit card debt (utilization still under 30% because they have $12,000 in total credit limit)
- Contributing 3% to their 401(k) — just enough for the employer match
- Savings rate: approximately 2%
- Net worth: negative $40,000

Credit score: 760. Financial health: fragile. One layoff, one medical bill, one car breakdown away from a crisis.

The credit score is high because they've never missed a payment, their utilization is under 30%, and they've had credit cards since college. By FICO's criteria, they're excellent. By any holistic measure, they're walking a tightrope.

## How can someone have a low credit score and be financially healthy?

The reverse also happens. Someone who paid off all their debt, closed their credit cards, and operates on a cash/debit-only basis will watch their credit score drop. No active credit accounts means no payment history being generated, no utilization ratio, and a thinning credit file.

I've met people with $500,000 in the bank and a 640 credit score because they haven't borrowed money in eight years. By every meaningful metric, they're wealthy. By FICO's criteria, they're a "fair" credit risk.

This is absurd, but it makes sense when you remember what the score is for: it exists to help *lenders*, not you.

## What should you actually measure?

Here are six metrics that tell you more about your financial health than your credit score ever could:

### 1. Savings rate

**What it is:** The percentage of your gross income that you save each month.

**Why it matters:** Your savings rate is the single strongest predictor of long-term wealth. Someone earning $60,000 who saves 20% ($12,000/year) will build more wealth than someone earning $120,000 who saves 5% ($6,000/year).

**Target:** 15-20% of gross income. Under 10% means you're building wealth slowly. Over 25% means you're on an accelerated path to financial independence.

### 2. Emergency fund coverage

**What it is:** How many months of essential expenses your liquid savings can cover.

**Why it matters:** This is your financial shock absorber. Job loss, medical emergency, car repair — emergencies are inevitable. The only question is whether you'll handle them with savings or debt.

**Target:** 3-6 months of essential expenses. For a household spending $3,500/month on essentials, that's $10,500–$21,000 in a savings account. If you have irregular income, aim for 6-9 months.

As of 2025, 44% of Americans cannot cover a $1,000 emergency expense with savings. That's not a credit score problem — that's a financial health crisis.

### 3. Debt-to-income ratio (DTI)

**What it is:** Your total monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income.

**Why it matters:** Lenders actually do use this one (separately from your credit score) for mortgage approvals, but it's valuable for your own assessment too. A DTI over 36% means debt is consuming too much of your income. Over 43% and most lenders won't approve a mortgage.

**Target:** Under 20% is healthy. Under 36% is acceptable. Over 43% is a red flag.

**Example:** $85,000 income = $7,083/month gross. Student loan payment ($487) + car payment ($350) + credit card minimums ($96) = $933/month in debt payments. DTI = 13.2%. Manageable.

### 4. Net worth trajectory

**What it is:** Your total assets minus your total liabilities — and whether that number is going up.

**Why it matters:** The absolute number matters less than the direction. A 25-year-old with a negative net worth (thanks, student loans) is perfectly normal. But that number should be moving toward zero and then positive. If your net worth is flat or declining year over year, something needs to change.

**Benchmark by age (median, U.S.):**
- Under 35: $39,000
- 35-44: $135,000
- 45-54: $247,000
- 55-64: $364,000

These are medians, not targets. If you're above them, you're doing better than most. If you're below, don't panic — but make sure the trend line is heading up.

### 5. Budget adherence

**What it is:** The percentage of months where you spent within your planned budget.

**Why it matters:** Having a budget means nothing if you don't follow it. Consistent budget adherence — even an imperfect budget — builds the financial habits that drive every other metric on this list. Aim for 8 out of 12 months in compliance. Perfect is unrealistic; consistent is transformative.

### 6. Retirement readiness

**What it is:** Whether your current savings rate and investment balance put you on track for your target retirement age.

**Why it matters:** This is the long game. A common benchmark: have 1x your salary saved by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, and 10x by 67. If you're 35 with $100,000 saved and earn $80,000, you're slightly behind (target: $240,000) — but still in recoverable territory if you increase contributions.

## What is a Financial Health Score?

A Financial Health Score combines these metrics into a single number that reflects your actual financial wellbeing. Unlike a credit score, which exists to serve lenders, a Financial Health Score exists to serve *you*.

[Thallo](https://usethallo.com) calculates a Financial Health Score from 0-100 based on your savings rate, emergency fund coverage, DTI, budget adherence, and net worth trajectory. It updates automatically as your financial picture changes, and it gives you specific actions to improve — not just a number.

Here's a rough breakdown of what the ranges mean:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 80-100 | Strong financial health. Saving well, minimal problematic debt, solid emergency fund |
| 60-79 | Good foundation with room for improvement. Usually missing one or two key areas |
| 40-59 | Moderate financial stress. Likely low savings or high debt |
| 20-39 | Financial vulnerability. Multiple areas need attention |
| 0-19 | Financial crisis. Immediate action needed |

The average American would score roughly 45-55 on this scale. Not terrible, not great. Usually pulled down by low savings rates and inadequate emergency funds.

## Should you still care about your credit score?

Yes — but for practical purposes, not as a life score.

You need a decent credit score (670+) to get reasonable interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and to pass rental applications. A score above 740 gets you the best rates available. Above 780, there's no additional benefit.

Check your credit score once or twice a year. Dispute errors if you find them. Keep your utilization under 30%. Pay your bills on time. Beyond that, stop obsessing over it.

Your credit score tells lenders how you handle debt. Your financial health tells *you* how you handle money. They're different questions, and the second one matters a lot more for your actual life.

## FAQ

### What is a good Financial Health Score?
A Financial Health Score of 60+ indicates a solid financial foundation. Scores above 80 represent strong financial health across savings, debt management, emergency preparedness, and long-term wealth building. The average American would score approximately 45-55.

### Can you have a high credit score and still be in financial trouble?
Yes. A person with a 780 credit score can have zero savings, high debt, and no retirement contributions. Credit scores only measure borrowing behavior (payment history, utilization, account age) and ignore savings, net worth, income, and emergency preparedness.

### What's the difference between a credit score and a Financial Health Score?
A credit score (300-850) measures how reliably you repay borrowed money, designed to help lenders. A Financial Health Score (0-100) measures overall financial wellbeing across multiple dimensions including savings rate, emergency fund, debt-to-income ratio, and net worth trajectory — designed to help you.

### How much should I have in my emergency fund?
You should have 3-6 months of essential expenses in a liquid savings account. For a household spending $3,500/month on essentials, that means $10,500–$21,000. If you have irregular income or work in a volatile industry, aim for 6-9 months.

### What's a healthy debt-to-income ratio?
A debt-to-income ratio under 20% is considered healthy. Under 36% is acceptable for most lenders. Over 43% is a red flag that makes mortgage approval difficult and indicates debt may be consuming too much of your income.
