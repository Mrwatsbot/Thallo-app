# Thallo - Financial Health Platform

## About
Thallo is a budget and financial health platform that helps people build better money habits and real wealth.

## What We Do

## Why We're Different
Unlike traditional credit scores (FICO) which predict default risk for lenders, Thallo's Financial Health Score measures YOUR actual financial wellbeing:
- Rewards paying OFF debt (not just managing it)
- Tracks savings rate and wealth building velocity

- Fully transparent scoring with visible factor weights
- Optimized for your financial health, not lender profit
